Heterogeneous sharding can be used to allow higher gas(does gas still exist?)
transactions without affecting block latency.

Under the current Phase 1 implementation, we have collation body sizes of each shard
fixed at 1MB.  By allowing different shards different (but fixed) collation sizes,
we can allow higher gas transactions on certain shards, without altering period
length.

Instead of altering period length, we can instead grant notaries the ability to
submit collation headers up to floor(collation_size/1MB) - 1 periods ahead.

Additionally, we need to reward notaries proportional to the collation size of
the shard they have been assigned to to account for the additional time to download
and vote on the collation.

We also need to set the notary burst overhead to be proportional to the collation
size as well in order to give notaries time to download transactions.

The main issue at hand is whether this interferes with random sampling
from the validator pool and consequently allows coordinated attacks on shards.
[why it doesn't matter for sampling and collusion that we do this.]

Another concern is whether 

The other concern is determining the appropriate collation sizes for an appropriate
distribution of shards.
