Sharding -- Staggered Periods
Idea: stagger sharding periods s.t. you don't need to wait every PERIOD_LENGTH
      blocks in order to verify

Concerns:
- would this interfere with sampling scheme?
  - you'd have two different notary registries, since they never fall on the same
    period (assuming same length periods), which means that you have to think about
    nodes colluding to join the same registry and make it more likely to get a
    majority in one shard
- cross-shard transactions


Focuses:
- need to ensure that notary registry does not allow for collusion
- cross-shard transactions


How Would This Work?:
Basic idea:
2 "tracks"
Each track has half of the shards
Same period length, but period ends midway through the opposite track's period
Cross-shard transactions work the same way, I don't foresee a problem, also the
  implementation of that hasn't really even been rolled out, so more to come on
  that front.

Sampling:
Maintaining resistance against 1% attacks is the most important concern.  Since
the periods of these two tracks are staggered, the notaries selected by the opposite
track for its current period will be out of the notary registry.  This means that
malicious notaries could...what?
